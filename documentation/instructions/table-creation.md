# How to create tables in the design pattern ecocomDP 

Introduction
---

This document contains guidelines for creating tables in this design pattern.

General guidelines
---

1. Our goal is to provide data in regular formats to simplify querying and synthesis. DO NOT calculate values or aggregate primary observations (in the observation table). Users (e.g., data synthesis working groups) will perform these calcluations for their own needs. 
2. Conversion requires a basic understanding of the data. You will need to assemble available metadata, and spend time exploring.
3. If L0 data are already in the EDI repository, the entities and some medata can be accessed via the autogenerated code web services.
4. The three ancillary tables (taxon_ancillary, location_ancillary, observation_ancillary) may have aggregated data. If you aggreagate values in these tables, include a copy of the raw data table (L0) with the final L1 data package so that additional details are easy to find. A situation where this might happen is when the ancillary data have more structure than the primary observation data, e.g., a plankton tow (through a water column) is accompanied by a profile (with a discrete value at each depth). The profile values could be averaged for the observation_ancillary table, but the profile structure may be of interest as well, so include it (e.g., as an 8th table). Keep in mind: in a design pattern for biogeochemistry data, data in the profile would be the 'primary observations', and values would not be averaged! 
5. To be flexible, this design pattern uses a long format, with key-value pairs (plus a "unit"), where key = the variable name. We have observed this format used in a variety of applications where data from mulitple sources are combined. There is a drawback to this format however, mainly that the definition of the key (variable_name) is generally uncontrolled and with little typing. Including a unit field helps aleviate this to some extent, and we are exploring ways to add semantic meaning to measurement fields. We recommend that the EML metadata for variable fields be constructed as code-definition pairs (an EML "enumeratedList"), so that every variable_name is accompanied by a definition. If L0 data already have EML metadata, these definitions can be found at this XPath: //dataset/dataTable/attributeList/attribute/defininition
6. Use column names of the L0 as variable names of the L1 when possible. This automates definition of key-value pairs.
7. Use functions from the `ecocomDP` R package to help you create tables:
    * `make_location` - Make the location table from a data frame containig sampling location names, an ordered vector of location hierarchy (for nested locations). See function documentation for details (i.e. `?make_location`.
    * `make_variable_mapping` - Initialize the variable mapping table from input data frames of other ecocomDP tables. This function populates the variable_mapping_id, table_name, and variable_name. Linkage to ontologies must be done manually. See function documentation for details (i.e. `?make_variable_mapping`).
8. The process of converting L0 to L1 should be fully scripted to enable future updates to the L1 when the L0 is updated. The preferred scripting language is R, but other languages are acceptable. This conversion script will be archived with the L1 tables and called upon to revise L1 data when L0 updates occur. The conversion script should only require 3 input arguments:
    1. __path__ - The path to where the L1 tables will be exported
    2. __parent.pkg.id__ - The L0 package ID (e.g. knb-lter-cap.627.2)
    3. __child.pkg.id__ - The L1 package ID (e.g. edi.101.3)
A good example of a conversion script is "conversion_cap652.r" of [this data package](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=edi.247.2).


Table list 
---
Tables are listed here in suggested population order, i.e., parents first. 
The location and taxon tables are most likely to come first, but could be in either order, as they are equal parents of observation. A minimum of 4 tables is required (e.g., if there is no ancillary information to include).

|  order | table name 	|   required?	|   references tables    | description            | 
|--------|--------------|---------------|------------------------|------------------------|
|1.|location              |yes|NA              |basic info to identify a place    |  
|2.|taxon                 |yes|NA              |basic info to identify an organism | 
|3.|observation           |yes|location, taxon |observations about taxa that will be analyzed (organism abundance or density, or the data to compute these, e.g., count) |  
|4.|location_ancillary    |no |location        |additional info about a place that does not change, in long format. |
|5.|taxon_ancillary       |no |taxon           |additonal info about an organism that does not change, in long format |
|6.|observation_ancillary |no |observation     |additional info to contextualize the observation (not specific to the taxon or locations) in long-format  |  
|7.|dataset_summary       |yes|observation     |summary info calculated from incoming data. This is a one-line table |
|8.|variable_mapping      |no| observation, observation_ancillary, location_ancillary, taxon_ancillary | table variables and definitions|


_____
Tables
---
Table: location
---
Description: identifying info about a place (lon, lat, elev). This table is self-referencing, to enable nested sites. Use the `make_location` function of the `ecocomDP` R package to create this table.

Column notes

|  column name 	|   type   | required | references cols | note |
|---------------|----------|----------|-----------------|-------|
| location_id        |char |yes|NA|Likely to be the local id used in the L0 dataset| 
| location_name      |char |no |NA | 		|
| latitude 	         |float|no |NA |decimal degrees|
| longitude 	     |float|no |NA |decimal degrees|
| elevation	         |float|no |NA |relative to sea level|
| parent_location_id |char | no|NA| Use this column to reference another site in the same table, for nested sample design	|


Table: taxon
---
Description: identifying information about a taxon, eg, name, id and system. 
This is likely to take extra time if data contributors have used local names or codes, or common names instead of species binomials. Use the `trim_taxa`, `resolve_sci_taxa`, and `resolve_comm_taxa` of the `[taxonomyCleanr](https://github.com/EDIorg/taxonomyCleanr)` R package to resolve your list of taxa names to an authority system and get the taxon_rank, authority_system, and authority_taxon_id.

Column notes

|  column name 	|   type   | required |  references cols 	| note |
|---------------|-----------|----------|--------------------|-------|
|taxon_id           | char |yes|NA |very likely to be the local id used in the L0 dataset |  
|taxon_rank         | char |no |NA |all ranks may be documented, minimally lowest level of identification in L0 |   
|taxon_name         | char |yes|NA |Latin name corresponding to taxon_rank| 
|authority_system   | char |no |NA |use a recognized service, eg, ITIS, WoRMS, USDA |  
|authority_taxon_id | char |no |NA |use a lookup service (eg, taxize) to find the ID assigned by a taxon system, like ITIS.|


Table: observation
---
Description: This is the core table - which holds the observations being analyzed, eg, organism abundance or density.  
or the data to compute density (count).
Observations must be linked to a taxon and a location


Column notes

|  column name 	|   type	| required |  references cols 	| note |
|---------------|-----------|----------|-------------------|-------|  
|observation_id       |char |yes       |NA    	|most likely, will not be in the L0 data, so autogenerate after table is populated	|
|event_id             |char |no (see note) | observation_ancillary.event_id     | required if the observation_ancillary table is used      |
|package_id           |char |yes       | NA  	|   	|
|location_id          |char |yes       |location.location_id |   	|
|observation_datetime |datetime  |yes  |NA   	|ISO preferred 	    |
|taxon_id             |char |yes       |taxon.taxon_id | 	|
|variable_name        |char |yes       |NA 	|  in EML metadata, these should be code-def pairs (enumeratedList)  	|
|value                |float|yes       |NA   	|Note type is float, because we expect these values to be numeric 	|
|unit                 |char |yes       |NA   	|if L0 has EML, see attribute/unit field	|

Table: location_ancillary 
---
Description: additional info about a place that does not change frequently, 
eg, lake area or depth, experimental treatment. 
features that change frequently (e.g, air temperature at a place) should be placed in the "observation_ancillary" table 

Column notes

|  column name  |   type    | required |  references cols   | note |
|---------------|-----------|----------|-------------------|-------|  
|location_ancillary_id |char |yes|NA   |  	|
|location_id           |char |yes|location.location_id |  	|
|datetime              |datetime|no|NA |ISO preferred. column is included because some info about a location (e.g., experimental treatment or natural disturbance) is not recorded at the same datetime as the observaiton  	| 
|variable_name         |char |yes|NA   |in EML metadata, these should be code-def pairs (enumeratedList)  	|
|value                 |char |yes|NA   |note that typing is char, to accomodate strings    	|
|unit                  |char |no|NA    |    	|



Table: taxon_ancillary
---
Description: additional info about an organism that does not change frequently, 
eg, trophic level  
features that change frequently are probably primary observations

Column notes

|  column name  |   type    | required |  references cols   | note |
|---------------|-----------|----------|--------------------|-------|  
|taxon_ancillary_id |char |yes|NA   	              |   	|autogenerated unique record ID|

|datetime       |datetime |no|   	              |ISO preferred. column is included because some info about a taxon (e.g., grwoth stage, trophic level) is not recorded at the same datetime as the observaiton    	|
|variable_name      |char |yes|   	              |in EML metadata, these should be code-def pairs (enumeratedList) 	|
|value              |char |yes|   	              |note that typing is char, to accomodate strings |
|unit               |char |no|   	              | 	|



Table: observation_ancillary 
---
Description: ancillary information about an observational event for context, but that are not about the organism or sampling location. Examples: water depth, height of a tower, temperature of medium. 

This table can hold a variety of measurements, and the relationship to the observation table is "many-to-many", that is, there may be many core observation and many ancillary observations collected during the same event (unlike the relationships in the other two ancillary-table pairs, which are one-to-many). For this reason, the relationship linking the event_id in the two tables is depicted graphically with a dotted line [see ecocomDP.png](ecocomDP.png).  

There is no datatime field in the observation_ancillary table. Since it is context for the observation, and happening at the same time, it will inherit observation datetimes.

Recommendations for handling or joining observation and observation_ancillary can be found on the [table merging](../table_merging.md) page.


Column notes

|  column name  |   type    | required |  references cols   | note |
|---------------|-----------|----------|--------------------|-------|  
|observation_ancillary_id | char |yes| NA	|  	|
|event_id       | char    |yes| observation.event_id	| participates in the the many:many relationship with observation	  	|
|variable_name            | char |yes| NA | in EML metadata, these should be code-def pairs (enumeratedList)  		|
|value                    | char | no| NA	|note that typing is char, to accomodate strings|
|unit                     | char | no| NA	|   	|


Table: dataset_summary
---
Description: summary info about the dataset. This is a one-line table that can be created by a utility function after the other tables are finished.
For this function, see: [link TBD]().

Columns

|  column name  |   type           | required |  references cols   | note |
|---------------|-----------|----------|--------------------|-------|  
|package_id                  |char |yes| (table = observation) package_id    |  id of the L1 pkg (this package)      |

|max_num_taxa                |integer    |yes|       |      |
|geo_extent_bounding_box_m2  |float      |no|    |     |


Table: variable_mapping
---
Description: Information linking a variable_name used in a data table to an external definition. This optional table holds mappings (or relations) between variable names in the data tables and measurement definitions external to the data package. Use the `make_variable_mapping` function of the `ecocomDP` R package to create this table (NOTE: the columns mapped_system, mapped_id, and mapped_label must be manually filled out).

Columns

|  column name  |   type           | required |  references cols   | note |
|---------------|-----------|----------|--------------------|-------|  
|variable_mapping_id                  |char |yes| NA    |  The ID of the variable mapping, a row or record identifier  |
|table_name         |char |yes|  NA |  The name of the table holding this variable |
|variable_name      |char   |yes| NA | The varaible name in another data table    | 
|mapped system     |char   |no|  NA  | System defining this variable name |
|mapped_id |char     |no| NA   | ID of the definition in that system  |
|mapped_label                |char    |no| NA  | Label for this variable in that mapped system |

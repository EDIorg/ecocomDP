# ecocomDP: A dataset design pattern for ecological community data to facilitate synthesis and reuse

With the almost forty year existence of the Long-term Ecological Research (LTER) Network and other networks worldwide, a diverse array of long-term observational and experimental data is becoming increasingly available. A number of data repositories are making the data accessible, with the intent that accompanying detailed metadata allow meaningful reuse, repurpose and integration with other data. 

However, in synthesis research the largest time investment is still in discovering, cleaning and combining primary datasets until all data are completely understood and converted to a similar format. There are two approaches to achieving this data regularity: a) to prescribe the format before data collection starts, or b) to convert primary data into a flexible intermediate format for reuse. Prescribed formats have rarely been successful due to a wide range of ecosystems represented, original research questions that drive collection, and varying sampling and analysis methods. Hence, we took the second approach: define a flexible intermediate data model, and convert primary data to it. In the context of the Environmental Data Initiativeâ€™s data repository, this allows us to maintain the original dataset, which is most convenient for descibing and answering the original research questions (and does not interfere with depositors' existing practices), add a conversion script to reformat the data into the intermediate format and make the harmonized intermediate available to synthesis research. This pre-harmonization step may be accomplished by data managers because the dataset still contains all original information without aggregation, filtering or cleaning necessary for targeted research questions. Although the data are still distributed into distinct datasets, they can easily be discovered, aggregated, and converted further into other formats, for specific secondary use.

### Use ecocomDP data

* Find:
    * Use the [`view_all_ecocomDP()`](https://github.com/EDIorg/ecocomDP/tree/master/documentation/instructions#discover) function to list all ecocomDP datasets. This function is apart of the `ecocomDP` R package.

    * [National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON)](https://github.com/EDIorg/ecocomDP/tree/master/documentation/examples/NEON) Use the [`view_all_ecocomDP()`](https://github.com/EDIorg/ecocomDP/tree/master/documentation/instructions#discover) function to list all NEON data available in the ecocomDP format. This function is apart of the `ecocomDP` R package.
* Import to R:
    * Use the [`aggregate_ecocomDP()`](https://github.com/EDIorg/ecocomDP/tree/master/documentation/instructions#reuse) function to combine ecocomDP datasets. This function is apart of the `ecocomDP` R package.

### PostgreSQL

[A PostgreSQL implementation of ecocomDP can be found here](https://github.com/EDIorg/ecocomDP/tree/master/postgreSQL).

### R package

The R package helps create, validate, document, archive, discover, and use ecocomDP data.

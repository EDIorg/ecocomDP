Title: Tools to Create, Use, and Convert ecocomDP Data
Description: Work with the Ecological Community Data Design Pattern. 'ecocomDP' 
    is a flexible data model for harmonizing ecological community surveys, in a 
    research question agnostic format, from source data published across 
    repositories, and with methods that keep the derived data up-to-date as the 
    underlying sources change. Described in O'Brien et al. (2021), 
    <doi:10.1016/j.ecoinf.2021.101374>.

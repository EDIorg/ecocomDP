Image key: The optional tables are partly transparent.  The primary key for each table is the id (column named "table_name_id", with a green background. Columns that should be unique (as a group), have a yellow background. Many:many relationships are shown with dotted lines (side note: if this model were implemented in a relational database, each many:many relationship would require an intermeiate table).

[table_descriptions.md](https://github.com/EDIorg/ecocomDP/blob/master/documentation/model/table_description.md) An authoritative set of table descriptions, relationships, and requirements.

# Contributing Guidelines

## git structure

The active branch is `development`. `development` is merged into `master` for releases. Please submit your pull requests to `development`.

## Repository structure

This repository is structured as a standard R package following the conventions outlined in the [Writing R extensions](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html) manual. A few additional files are provided that are not part of the built
R package and are listed in `.Rbuildignore`, such as `.travis.yml`, which is used for continuous testing and integration.

## Code

All code for this package is found in `R/`. All functions should be thoroughly documented with `roxygen2` notation; see Documentation. Code should
conform to the rOpenSci [Style guide](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/blob/master/packaging_guide.md).

## Testing

Any new feature or bug-fix should include a unit-test demonstrating the change.  Unit tests follow the `testthat` framework with files in
`tests/testthat`.  Please make sure that the testing suite passes before issuing a pull request.  This can be done by running `check()`
from the `devtools` package, which will also check for consistent documentation, etc.


This package uses the [travis](https://github.com/craigcitro/r-travis) continuous testing mechanism for R to ensure that the test suite is run
on each push to Github.  An icon at the top of the README.md indicates whether or not the tests are currently passing.

## Documentation

All of the function documentation is generated automatically. Please do not edit any of the documentation files in `man/`
or the `NAMESPACE`.  Instead, construct the appropriate [roxygen2](https://github.com/klutometis/roxygen) documentation in the
function files in `R/` themselves.  The documentation is then generated by running the `document()` function from the `devtools` package.  Please
consult the [Advanced R programming](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/) guide if this workflow is unfamiliar to you.  Note that functions should include
examples in the documentation. Please use `\dontrun` for examples that take more than a few seconds to execute or require an internet connection.

Likewise, the README.md file in the base directory should not be edited directly.  This file is created automatically from code that runs the
examples shown, helping to ensure that they are functioning as advertised and consistent with the package README vignette.  Instead, edit the
`README.Rmd` source file in `manuscripts` and run `make` to build the README.

## General Development Goals & Guidelines

1. High-level functions to create, validate, and use ecocomDP datasets.

## Attribution

These contributing guidelines are based on those of the [rOpenSci EML project](https://github.com/ropensci/EML/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

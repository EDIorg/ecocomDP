# Cleaning taxonomic data and resolving authority IDs

Introduction
---
While you are going through the effort of reformatting a dataset to ecocomDP to make it easily aggregated with other ecocomDP, you may as well update the taxonomic data with authority IDs and taxonomic serial numbers (TSNs) to make the taxonomic information of these datasets relatable. We are developing a workflow in R that leans on the taxize toolbelt [(Chamberlain et al. 2016)](https://github.com/ropensci/taxize). Check back soon!

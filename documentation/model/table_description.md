# Design Pattern - ecocomDP 

Introduction
---
The ecocom design pattern (ecocomDP) is planned to be a flexible intermediate for ecological community survey data. 
For information on the process see https://environmentaldatainitiative.org/resources/tools/dataset-design/

The ecocomDP is composed of 8 tables, which can be linked via identifiers. This document describes the tables and their contents (columns). Examples of tables can be found in the /examples/ directory. The graphic showing all data objects and their relationships was created from a relational database implementation (PostgreSQL, see the top-level directory of that name for DDL). Three tables are required (“observation”, “location”, “taxon”). The “dataset_summary” is populated from the “observation” table by code.  Two tables hold links to external resources: taxon, and variable_mappings. The taxon table is specifically designed to hold lookup-info from a service such as ITIS. The variable_mappings table hold URIs and lables for external measurement dictionaries.  

Each main table has an optional ancillary table for additional information. These are included because primary research typically includes related measurements which may be of interest during anlaysis. 

Below is the table list and suggested population order, ie, parents first.

|  order | table name 	|   required?	|   references tables    | description            | sample cols (examples)   | unique constraints |

Tables
---
Table: location
---
Description: identifying information about a place (lonitude, latitude, elevation). The table is self-referencing so that sites can be nested. The example is for a transect, with a reference to another parent-row.	

Columns

|  column name 	|   type	|   not NULL required?	|  references cols 	| description | example |
|---------------|---------|-----------------------|-------------------|-------------|---------|
| location_id | character | yes  	      |   NA| Identifier assigned to each unique entry. | sbclter_abur_I |
| location_name   	|  character  	| no 	|   NA | Sampling location full name.	|  Arroyo Burro Reef, transect I 	|
| latitude 	  |  float 	|   	no                  |   NA |Latitude in decimal degrees. Latitudes south of the equator are negative.|  34.400275	|
| longitude 	|  float 	|   	no                  |   NA |Longitude in decimal degrees. Longitudes west of the prime meridian are negative.| -119.7445915 |
| elevation	  |  float 	|   	np                  |   NA |Sampling location elevation in meters relative to sea level. Above sea level is positive. Below sea level is negative.| -15	|
| parent_location_id	|  character | no  	|   NA| Sampling location identifier from this table for the parent of this sampling location. Presence indicates nested locations.	|  sbclter_abur	|


Table: taxon
---
Description: identifying information about a taxon, eg, name, id and system. When table is constructed, use a lookup service (eg, taxize) to find the ID assigned by a taxon system, like ITIS. 

Columns

|  column name 	|   type	| not NULL required? |  references cols 	| description | example |
|---------------|---------|--------------------|-------------------|--------------|---------|
| taxon_id           | character |  yes        | NA | ID used in the dataset | sbclter_MAPY |  
|	taxon_rank         | character |  no         | NA | Taxonomic rank of the organism name | species |   
|	taxon_name         | character |  yes        | NA | Species name | M. pyrifera | 
|	authority_system   | character |  no         | NA | Name of the system assigning the taxon ID | ITIS|  
|	authority_taxon_id | character |  no         | NA | ID in the authority system |  11274|


Table: observation
---
Description: This is the core table - which holds the observations being analyzed, eg, organism abundance or density. Observations must be linked to a taxon and to a location. Linking to ancillary observations (via event_id) is optional, and event_id is required to be populated only if the observation_ancillary table is created.

Columns

|  column name 	|   type	|   not NULL required?	|  references cols 	| description | example |
|---------------|---------|-----------------------|-------------------|--------------|---------|  
| observation_id         | character |yes|   	|  A unique id for this record      |  4161   	|
| event_id             | character |yes|(table = observation_ancillary) event_id    | The ID of the sampling event, required if observation_ancillary table is included   | 2009mar03_dive1      |

| variable_name        | character |yes|   	| name of the variable measured. in EML metadata, these should be code-def pairs (enumeratedList)  	|  kelp_density  	|
| value                | float     |yes|   	| value for the variable  	| 7  	|
| unit                 | character |yes|   	| unit for this variable  	|  numberPerMeterSquared 	|

Table: location_ancillary 
---
Description: additional information about a place that does not change frequently, e.g., lake area or depth, experimental treatment. Features that change frequently are probably more closely related to the observational event, and so should be kept in the "observation_ancillary" table. Ancillary observations are linked through the location_id, and one location_id may have many ancillary observations about it.

Columns

|  column name 	|   type	|   not NULL required?	|  references cols 	| description | example |
|---------------|---------|-----------------------|-------------------|-------------|---------| 
|location_ancillary_id | character |yes|          |   Identifier of the sampling location ancillary.	|   	|

|datetime              | datetime  |no |          | date and time of the ancillary info, ISO datetime	|  experimental treatment date 	| 
|variable_name         | character |yes|   	      |  variable that was measured. in EML metadata, these should be code-def pairs (enumeratedList) 	| treatment  	|
|value                 | character |yes|   	      |  value for the variable 	| kelp removal  	|
|unit                  | character |no |   	      |  unit for this variable 	|   	|



Table: taxon_ancillary
---
Description: additional info about an organism that does not change frequently, eg, trophic level. Teatures that change frequently are probably observations. Ancillary observations are linked through the taxon_id, and one taxon_id may have many ancillary observations about it.

Columns

|  column name 	|   type	|   not NULL required?	|  references cols 	| description | example |
|---------------|---------|-----------------------|-------------------|--------------|---------|

| author             | character | no |           | Author associated with taxon identification for this dataset |    |



Table: observation_ancillary 
---
Description: ancillary information about an observational event for context, but that are not about the organism or sampling location. Examples: water depth, height of a tower, temperature of medium. These are very often "environmental driver" data in analyses.

This table can hold a variety of measurements, and the relationship to the observation table is "many-to-many", that is, there may be many core observation and many ancillary observations collected during the same event (unlike the relationships in the other two ancillary-table pairs, which are one-to-many). For this reason, the relationship linking the event_id in the two tables is depicted graphically with a dotted line [see ecocomDP.png](ecocomDP.png)). Recommendations for handling or joining observation and observation_ancillary can be found in the [instructions](../instructions).

Columns

Table: variable_mappings 
---
Description: Information linking a variable_name used in a data table to an external definition

This optional table holds mappings (or relations) between variable names in the data tables and measurement definitions external to the data package. This table has multiple uses: 

- provides definitions for variables in the datasets (more extensive than might be found in metadata) 
- code can use this table to  to create EML code-definition pairs or annotations in metadata
- a single column in a data table may have mappings to multiple dictionaries, by including multiple rows for it

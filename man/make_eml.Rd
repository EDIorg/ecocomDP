\usage{
make_eml(data.path = "", code.path = "", parent.package.id = "", 
    child.package.id = "", sep = "", user.id = "", author.system = "", 
    intellectual.rights = "", access.url = "")
}
\arguments{
\item{data.path}{A character string specifying the path to the dataset working directory 
containing the validated ecocomDP tables.}

\item{code.path}{A character string specifying the path to the directory containing the 
scripts used in processing the L0 data to the L1 data.}

\item{parent.package.id}{A character string specifying the identifier of parent data package in the 
EDI data repository (e.g. "knb-lter-hfr.118.28").}

\item{child.package.id}{A character string specifying the identifier of child data package in 
the EDI data repository (e.g. "edi.53.1"). If you don't have a 
child.package.id then query EDI for one 
(info@environmentaldatainitiative.org).}

\item{sep}{The field separator string. Values within each row of ecocomDP tables
are separated by this string. Valid options are "," or "\t".}

\item{user.id}{A character string specifying the LTER or EDI ID of person publishing 
the ecocomDP data package (e.g. "EDI"). If you don't have a user ID then 
query EDI for one (info@environmentaldatainitiative.org).}

\item{author.system}{A character string specifying the author system the user.id is associated 
with (e.g. "edi"). If you don't have an author system specification use 
then query EDI for one (info@environmentaldatainitiative.org).}

\item{intellectual.rights}{A character string specifying the intellectual rights license to be used 
with the child ecocomDP data package. Valid arguments are "CCO" 
(https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode),
"CCBY" (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode), and no 
argument. No input argument indicates the license wil remain the same
as the parent data package.}

\item{access.url}{(Not required) A character string specifying the base URL that PASTA uses to upload the 
ecocomDP tables and associated processing scripts. For example, the base 
URL of a table that has a URL of 
https://lter.limnology.wisc.edu/sites/default/files/data/gleon_chloride/gleon_chloride_concentrations.csv
has a base URL of 
https://lter.limnology.wisc.edu/sites/default/files/data/gleon_chloride.}
}
\value{
An EML metadata file written to the dataset working directory titled 
    \emph{packageID.xml}.

\description{
Makes EML for an Ecological Community Data Pattern (ecocomDP).
}
\details{
Make and validate EML for an Ecological Community Data Pattern 
    (ecocomDP) using elements from the parent data package. This function 
    does not yet support creation of data packages that are not already 
    published in the EDI (Environmental Data Initiative) data repository.
    
    Run \code{make_eml} after you have completed \emph{addtional_contact.txt},
    \emph{custom_units.txt} (if you're ecocomDP has custom units), and have
    provided definitions for variables listed in the ecocomDP tables. Use 
    \code{define_variables} to identify and define variables.

    This script modifies elements of the parent data package EML:
    \itemize{
        \item \strong{Access} Modifies access based on user supplied
        arguments.
        \item \strong{Publicaton date} Changes the publication date to when 
        the ecocomDP was created.
        \item \strong{Keywords} Adds two keyword sets which include the 
        key term "ecocomDP" and a set of keywords relevant to community data
        from the LTER controlled vocabulary.
        \item \strong{Intellectual rights} Updates the intellectual rights
        according to user specified arguments.
        \item \strong{Taxon coverage} This has not yet been implemented.
        \item \strong{Contact} Adds the ecocomDP creator as a contact.
        \item \strong{Provenance} Adds the provenance snippet from the 
        parent data package.
        \item \strong{Data tables} Adds data table elements for ecocomDP tables
        present.
        \item \strong{Formatting scripts} Adds formatting scripts used to 
        create the ecocomDP as otherEntitie.

Note for Colin -- composite key check in validation function doesn't seem to work correctly?

BEETLES -- map_neon.ecocomdp.10022.001.001
	problems 
		taxon table
			- taxon_id's with multiple records in taxon table, different "authority_system" entries -- e.g., OMUDEJ -- fixed in update #4 above
			- NAs in taxon_id -- fixed by update #3 above. 
		observation table
			- duplicate uid -- 
				536b7f1b-13a3-4c42-946b-09a0628fdaac -- event_id = ABBY_028.E.20190625, taxon = PTELAM, different counts -- 1 and 3. Should they be added? assumed to be reps? 
				- subsampleIDs
					- ABBY_028.E.20190625.IB.01 - A00000106176
					- ABBY_028.E.20190625.PTELAM.01 - A00000106844
						- activity in bet_sorting_in - 58e20535-4280-4149-9f89-aa09ad477497 -- individual count = 13 in sorting table. How did it get separated?
						- remarks -- 10 individuals from this sample pooled together. 3 pinned. -- suggesting we should add counts when multiple observations exist in the observation table. 
						DIAGNOSIS -- family not returned for the "pooled" sample record. Removing family since it can be recovered from NEON taxon tables anyway. 
					- ABBY_028.E.20190625.OMUDEJ.01 - 

	updates to neonDivData code
		- 1. added -- uid from bet_sorting as the observation_id 
		- 2. added -- filter bet_fielddata to only include sampleCollected == "Y"
		- 3. added -- filter out records where subsampleID == NA
		- 4. added -- concatenate different references for same taxonID so taxon_id is unique for each record in taxon table

	updates to what was in neonDivData -- just updates to reformat data for ecocomDP

MACROINVERTEBRATE -- map_neon.ecocomdp.20120.001.001
	problems
		- counts not standardized to area (or unit effort), see fix #1
		- duplicate records in fielddata table, see fix #2
		
	updates
		- 1. standardized counts to density per area sampled. 
		- 2. added code to select first uid when multiple uids are associated with a given sampleID in the fielddata table.

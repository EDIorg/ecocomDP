### Directory contents:

[ecocomDP.png](https://github.com/EDIorg/ecocomDP/blob/master/documentation/model/ecocomDP.png) A visualization of table contents and relationships. 

[ecocomDP.svg](https://github.com/EDIorg/ecocomDP/blob/master/documentation/model/ecocomDP.svg) A .svg rendering of the table relationships. 

Image Caption: The optional tables are partly transparent.  The primary key for each table is the id (column named "table_name_id", with a green background. Columns that (as a group) should be unique within the table, have a yellow background. Many:many relationships are shown with dotted lines (side note: if this model were implemented in a relational database, each many:many relationship would require an intermediate table).

[table_descriptions.md](https://github.com/EDIorg/ecocomDP/blob/master/documentation/model/table_description.md) An authoritative set of table descriptions, relationships, and requirements.

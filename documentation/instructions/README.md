# Instructions for creating an ecocomDP

Introduction
---
The ecocom design pattern (ecocomDP) is a flexible intermediate for ecological community survey data. 
For information on the entire process, including community workshops see https://environmentaldatainitiative.org/resources/tools/dataset-design/

The process of reformatting a Level 0 (L0) dataset to a Level 1  (L1) in the ecocom design pattern must be customized for each L0 dataset, making automation impossible.  However, we have identified some general steps to assist scripting the process. 

* Reformatting tables:
    * Detailed descriptions of the tables and relationships in the model: ../model

    * [Taxonomic lookup services help align species names, and confirm ids](https://github.com/EDIorg/ecocomDP/blob/master/documentation/instructions/taxon-cleaning.md)
* Checking table structure:

* Creating EML Metadata

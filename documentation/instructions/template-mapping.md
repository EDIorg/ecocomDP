The process of formatting a level-0 dataset to level-1 (ecocomDP) is variable and depends on several factors making a scripted solution difficult. However, we have identified some general steps that are helpful to follow in this process. Note, a few of the tables can be scripted and will be added to the ecocomDP R package soon.

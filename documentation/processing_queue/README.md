# Processing queue

Datasets to be converted into the ecocomDP are listed in the data processing queue:

* [data_processing_queue](https://github.com/EDIorg/ecocomDP/blob/master/documentation/processing_queue/data_processing_queue.csv).

Some characteristics to be considered when adding a dataset to the processing queue:

* Long-term data are valuable, but shouldn't be the only consideration.
* Datasets important to a research site are good candidates (i.e. used a lot by scientists or are from a cool experiment, etc.).
* Location specific datasets are good (i.e. not already aggregated into a larger dataset).
* Species names are specific and not aggregated to some subjective grouping.
* Methods are well described, especially when it's a manipulative experiment.
* Units of measure are well identified (e.g. numbers/minute without further explanation doesn't mean much).
* Number of species. Datasets with many species may be more highly valued than those with few.

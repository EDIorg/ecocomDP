## Overview

Tools to create, use, and convert ‘ecocomDP’ datasets. ‘ecocomDP’ is a
dataset design pattern for harmonizing ecological community surveys in a
research question agnostic format, from source datasets published across
multiple repositories, and with methods that keep the derived datasets
up-to-date as the underlying sources change.

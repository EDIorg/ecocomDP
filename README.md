# ecocomDP

A dataset design pattern for ecological community data.

## Getting Started

We are developing an R package of tools to help:

1. Create the ecocomDP tables.
2. Validate tables against the ecocomDP schema.
3. Make metadata, in the Ecological Metadata Language (EML), for a set of ecocomDP tables.
4. Aggregate ecocomDP data packages and create/export views.
    
These functions are in development and are not stable. Follow development in [projects](https://github.com/EDIorg/ecocomDP/projects).

### Installing

The ecocomDP R code package is available here on GitHub. To install you will need to install and load `devtools`.

```
# Install and load devtools
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)

# Install and load the ecocomDP
install_github("EDIorg/ecocomDP)
library(devtools)
```

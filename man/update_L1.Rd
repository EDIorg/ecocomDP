\usage{
update_L1(id.L0.newest, id.L1.newest, path, url, user.id, user.pass)
}
\arguments{
\item{id.L0.newest}{(character) Identifier of newest L0 data package.}

\item{id.L1.newest}{(character) Identifier of L0's newest L1 child to be created by this function. The L0-to-L1 conversion script of \code{id.L1.newest} will be used to create the child of \code{id.L0.newest}.}

\item{path}{(character) Directory to which L1 tables, scripts, and metadata will be written.}

\item{url}{(character) Publicly accessible URL to \code{path} for download by a data repository.}

\item{user.id}{(character) User identifier within a specified \code{repository}. This controls editing access in some \code{repository}.}

\item{user.pass}{(character) Password associated with \code{user.id} for repository upload.}
}
\description{
Updates an L1 data package when itâ€™s L0 parent data package has been updated. This function is a wrapper to several subroutines.
}
\details{
The updated L1 data package published in the data repository system specified by \code{repository} and in the sub-system specified by \code{environment}. Messaging from this routine is written to log_master.txt. Dependencies specified in conversion scripts are added to dependencies_update_L1.txt and installed in servers R distribution via \code{update_supported_libraries()}.

\code{user.id}, \code{repository}, and \code{user.pass} form a set of credentials allowing edits to all data packages within a repository system, otherwise evaluate/upload will fail if the creator is someone else.

Requires an L0 and L1 already exist in the repository, because the L1 creation and upload process may have errors that need resolution by a human.

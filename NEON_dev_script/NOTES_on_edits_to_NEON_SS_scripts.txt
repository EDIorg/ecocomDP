Note for Colin -- composite key check in validation function doesn't seem to work correctly? 

General notes
	- Should I pull taxon tables for each taxon group instead of using ID refs in data? Did this for birds, but other groups might be too cumbersom
	- make sure "release" is in obs ancillary table for each mapping function.
	- using neonUtilities to get taxon tables only returns nameAccordingToID, not nameAccordintTo. Will need ot update that in the future and/or make a lookup function by taxon -- so we don't need to download the entire table. 
	- when making the ancillary observation table, I keep finding that it is most useful to map observation_id to event_id to make ancillary observations map correctly. 
	

TODO --
	- update author lists for mapping functions
	- finalize workflow for taxa where modifications were made (below)
		beetles
		macroinvertebrates
		mosquitoes
		herps
		mammals
		ticks
		tick pathogens
	- shiny app
		update documentation
		add "aggregation" choice (none vs mean vs sum) for within group for a given value x.

BEETLES -- map_neon.ecocomdp.10022.001.001
	problems 
		taxon table
			- taxon_id's with multiple records in taxon table, different "authority_system" entries -- e.g., OMUDEJ -- fixed in update #4 
			- NAs in taxon_id -- fixed by update #3. 
		observation table
			- duplicate uid -- 
				536b7f1b-13a3-4c42-946b-09a0628fdaac -- event_id = ABBY_028.E.20190625, taxon = PTELAM, different counts -- 1 and 3. Should they be added? assumed to be reps? 
				- subsampleIDs
					- ABBY_028.E.20190625.IB.01 - A00000106176
					- ABBY_028.E.20190625.PTELAM.01 - A00000106844
						- activity in bet_sorting_in - 58e20535-4280-4149-9f89-aa09ad477497 -- individual count = 13 in sorting table. How did it get separated?
						- remarks -- 10 individuals from this sample pooled together. 3 pinned. -- suggesting we should add counts when multiple observations exist in the observation table. 
						DIAGNOSIS -- family not returned for the "pooled" sample record. Removing family since it can be recovered from NEON taxon tables anyway. 
					- ABBY_028.E.20190625.OMUDEJ.01 - 

	updates to neonDivData code
		- 1. added -- uid from bet_sorting as the observation_id 
		- 2. added -- filter bet_fielddata to only include sampleCollected == "Y"
		- 3. added -- filter out records where subsampleID == NA
		- 4. added -- concatenate different references for same taxonID so taxon_id is unique for each record in taxon table

BIRD -- map_neon.ecocomdp.10003.001.001
	problems
		- just reporting raw "clusterSize" as "count". Is this correct? Should we aggregate in anyway? Currently, in ecocomDP format, I've set event_id = observation_id so that all the ancillary obs information can map appropriately. We could aggregate/add counts for each taxonID, and then concatenate the ancillary information. Not sure if this would be appropriate or useful. 
		- could use a taxon ancillary table, but not implemented yet. 
		
	updates
		- 1. pull taxon table from neonUtilities -- the table isn't that big, so just pull it and get nameAccordintTo for each taxonID. 
	
	observation_id = uid (should be from brd_countdata)

SMALL_MAMMAL -- map_neon.ecocomdp.10072.001.001
	problems 
		- data were reported at individual level. ecocomDP is meant to aggretate individual observations. See update #2
		- recaptures are currently removed. If we're reporting per trapnight per plot, are we sure we want to do this? 
		- do not use fate to filter out "nontarget" taxa (per conversation with Sara on 3/2/2021) because it is unreliable -- i.e., field techs have filled it in wrong. Instead, filtered by trapStatus (see #3). Sara has indicated that non-target captures are given trapStatus = 2
		
	updates
		- 1. remove records where no animals were caught. 
		- 2. aggregated counts should be standardized to trapnight (per Kate T's recommendation), need to count the number of traps in a grid to get trapnights in a nightuid/event_id and report as "unique individuals per 100 trap nights per plot per month" for each bout in a grid/plot
			- take first day in bout as datetime
			- unique individuals per 100 trapnights per plot per bout
			- the year-month bout doesn't quite align with actual bouts... 
				e.g., DSNY_004, 2016-11 captures dates 11/2,3, 7, 8, 9, and 30.
		- 3. added dplyr::filter(dat.mam, trapStatus %in% c("5 - capture","4 - more than 1 capture in one trap"))

TICK -- map_neon.ecocomdp.10093.001.001
	problems 
		- should individualCounts that are NA be changed to 0? 
		- looks like we're including sampling events where no taxa were observed. Should we keep these? I'm assuming it's intentional, but just want to make sure.
		- count not standardized to area sampled
		- multiple life stages included in counts, should we aggregate? If not, this is not ideal for the ecocomDP data model. 
		
	updates	
		- 1. standardized counts to total area sampled
		
	observation_id = paste0("obs_",1:nrow(.))

Instructions for mapping to the Ecological Community Data Pattern (ecocomDP)
============================================================================

Open the tab delimited map.txt file in a spread sheet editor. Fill out the blank fields of this spread sheet to map your data (L0) to the Ecological Community Data Pattern (L1). Non-blank fields belong to L1.



Column definitions:
-------------------
L0_data_package_id - The data package ID associated with the data table file listed in L0_file_name. If no package ID exists, then supply a unique name. This can be a combination of alpha numeric values separated by periods or underscores.

L0_file_name - Full data table name (e.g. data_table_name.csv), from the data package listed in L0_data_package_id, and providing the attribute in L0_attribute. Spaces between words must be replaced with underscores.

L0_attribute - The attribute from L0_file_name that maps on to L1_attribute.

L1_table - Name of the L1 data table.

L1_attribute - The L1 attribute being mapped to from L0_attribute.

L1_type - The type of value for the corresponding L1_attribute, and required of the L0_attribute.

L1_default - 

L1_comment - Notes about what the L1_attribute represents.



Table notes:
------------

sampling_location - If sampling location contains self referencing sampling_location_id, then copy and paste a new set of sampling_location attributes for each self referencing entity.

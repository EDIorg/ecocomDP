Some L0 datasets contain tables that are purely population data, and do not fit the ecocomDP model (e.g. ADD DATA PACKAGE IDENTIFIER). Data are size and stem length of individual creosote (Larrea) plants, collected a the site level. Our decision was to leave this info out of the conversion, but that the abstract should have an additional paragraph saying that more data (population data) can be found in the original dataset.

Another CAP dataset had similar information, but since it was collected at a low level, it could be attached to specific observations as observation_ancillary.

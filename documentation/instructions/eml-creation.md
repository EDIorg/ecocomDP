# EML creation

Introduction
---
Once a dataset has been converted to the ecocomDP and subsequently validated you will need to create EML for it. Thankfully, the now standardized dataset combined with a few R functions makes creating EML relatively painless and quick. The current set of functions in the ecocomDP package accomodate the previous version of ecocomDP. This will be updated soon. Once they have been updated you will recieve a briefing on use of the package below.

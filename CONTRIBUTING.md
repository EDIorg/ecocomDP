# Introduction

Thank you for considering contributing to ecocomDP. Insights and contributions from people like you make this a more robust and useful project.

We are still developing the ecocomDP data pattern and will open our doors to community contributions once the project has solidified a bit more.

To contact a project lead please email info@environmentaldatainitiative.org.

Cheers!
